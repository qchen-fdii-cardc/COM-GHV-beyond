NASA Langley中心的高超声速飞行器模拟模型：翼锥构型[^Shaughnessy1990]。

[^Shaughnessy1990]: SHAUGHNESSY J D, PINCKNEY S Z, MCMINN J D, 等. Hypersonic vehicle simulation model: Winged-cone configuration: NAS 1.15:102610[R/OL]. (1990-11-01)[2025-03-12]. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19910003392.


Aerodynamic, propulsion, and mass models for a generic, horizontal-takeoff, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) configuration are presented which are suitable for use in point mass as well as batch and real-time six degree-of-freedom simulations.
